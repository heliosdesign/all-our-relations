<p>Sarah Cecilia Russell (later Mrs. William Smith Jr.) worked as a teacher on the reserve for eleven years. She first attended No. 7 school on the reserve, and then the Mohawk Institute for five years until Grade Eight, before going to high school in Brantford. Russell earned the Nelles medal from the Six Nations School Board for general proficiency. She began teaching in 1888 at the No. 7 school and then at the No. 3 school where she met her husband, William, a Dehorner and later an elected councillor. Aside from teaching, Sarah was involved in volunteer work in the community. She was also the Vice President of the Six Nations Women’s Patriotic League (Kanyengeh Church) during World War I and the founder of the Sour Springs Women’s Institute in 1921. Sarah was also the representative on the Mother’s Allowance Board in the 1920s, visiting families and widows on the reserve. When she died in 1929, Russell Ferrier noted that she was influential for good on the reserve, as she had brought up and educated a large family.</p></div>
