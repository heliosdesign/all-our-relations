<p>Known as “JB,” Jean-Baptiste Lépine settled in St. Francis Xavier as a young man.  It was there he married Julia Fleury. The scrip applications for the couple’s children read like a history of the seasonal and regional movements of the metis in the nineteenth century. As part of their livelihood, the Lepine family travelled the famous Carlton Trail pursuing the buffalo hunt.</p><p>The buffalo hunt required both skill and discipline to be successful. Scholars have long asserted that it was the organization, discipline, and skill that was maintained in the hunt that made the Metis a formidable fighting force.</p></div>
