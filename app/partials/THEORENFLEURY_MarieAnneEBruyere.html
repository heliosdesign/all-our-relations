<p>Mme Boyer (Marie Anne/Emmerance Bruyère) was a strong woman in her own right. According to the community history R.M. of Ellice 1883-1983, her marriage to Ambroise Boyer was her second. The account of the death of her<br>first husband suggests her clarity and strength:</p><p>While living on the prairies, Mrs. Ambroise Boyer's first husband, was warned by her not to light his pipe at night for the Sioux would shoot him. He lit it anyway and got shot. Right way she sent their 14 year old boy to look for a Metis camp and ask for help. It took him three days before he returned.</p><p>All this time she stayed and slept in a tent, with her husband who was dead - you had to be careful as the Sioux and the Metis were fighting then.</p></div>
