Camper a Roman Catholic (Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate) missionary who was based in the Métis settlement at St. Laurent (about 50 miles NW of Winnipeg). Moise Paul was at least briefly (in 1921) one of the chiefs of the Dog Creek Band (Lake Manitoba). His Lake Manitoba Band membership number was #64. He and his wife, Eloise or Elizabeth Misseabit, had 11 children.</p><p>St. Laurent was founded by Métis from Pembina and Red River in the 1820s. They were “attracted by the abundance of fish and wooded land nearby that abounded in game and wild fruit”. The mission served the area including Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, Duck Bay, Swan Lake, Ebb and Flow, Crane River, Waterhen River and Shoal River.</p></div>
