<p>Wally Fleury began playing hockey at ten years old, eventually playing in a number of communities, including Yorkton, SK. And Williams Lake, BC. A versatile athlete, in 1963 he was on his way to the New York Rangers’ fall training camp when, in the summer of that year, he broke his leg playing baseball. Although medical opinion held that he would never walk again, he persisted and rehabilitated his leg at home. But despite beating the medical odds he never recovered well enough to be able to join the NHL.</p><p>In addition to hockey and baseball, Wally Fleury has been a horseshoe player of note, a curler, and a competitive golfer.  Like many in his family, including “Butch” (Earl) Fleury (b. 22 April 1945. M. Maureen Campbell of Dauphin, 1974) and Butch’s daughter Amber Fleury (who appeared on Canadian Idol in 2005), he has a musical talent, singing and playing guitar.</p><p>In 2002, Wally Fleury accepted a Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee medal on Theoren Fleury’s behalf</p></div>
